##### This application allows you to upload PDF, Word, or text files and appends their content to a text file in a database folder. \
The appended data includes a timestamp and the text extracted from the uploaded file to use GPTs to manage your data as one text file to aovid potensial error in GPTs. 
The database text files are named in the format `gpts_db_<current_date>.txt`. 
This tool is useful for aggregating and storing text data from various documents in a structured format.
